Hi, Hope everying thing goes well with you.
This is Michelle who has tried to imrpove this coding project with some new features. 
It is a really great time to do this work and I think this is a very innovative project with meaningful extensible functionalities.
The skills and tools I used here are apollo, graphQL,TypeScript,OOP,FP, React, Redux(React-Redux),Hooks,recharts, Material-UI and etc.
And I'd like to list concise tips when configuring and running my project.

1. yarn install 
2. yarn start
3. it may takes some time to load the web page, then graphs will appear with updating rate 0.77 time/s 
4.click the buttons can choose which curve will appear in the dashboard and the chart tool help find the accurate values of target time
Hope my work will qualify your requirements.
5.one enhancement happened is that there is a record on the dashboard and and when click the point on the curve in some time the user are interested,
 it will record and display record on the dropdown box 
Thanks a lot for this chance and your patience to review!
